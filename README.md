# Managing the deployment parts of polar-book application CLOUD NATIVE

For the docker-compose.yml file the following is added as an env-var:
```yaml
    environment:
      - BPL_JVM_THREAD_COUNT=50
```
which is setting number of threads memory should be allocated for in the JVM stack.
The default value is 250 - but because this project requires some running containers,
the value is lowered so the computer won't be overloaded.

Spin up the containers described in the `docker-compose.yml` file if placed in directory
containing the docker-compose.yml file:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
else:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

If changes have been made to the `docker-compose.yml` file then docker-compose up -d
will reload the affected containers and not the ones already running which hasn't changed
(important to either stand in directory with docker-compose file or give as an argument the path):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop and remove docker containers executed with docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
